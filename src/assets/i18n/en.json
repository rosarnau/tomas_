   "Trained at the Real Conservatorio Superior de Música de Madrid, where he obtained the Honorary Prize for End of Degree Saxophone in 1997, his career has been marked by success from the very beginning. He was awarded the 1st Prize in the IV International Saxophone Competition of Benidorm and was selected as soloist by the prestigious European Union Youth Wind Orchestra (EUYWO) in 2003.",

   "His versatility has led him to collaborate with various symphonic and chamber ensembles, such as the Orquesta Sinfónica de la Comunidad de Madrid, the Orquesta de Cámara Andrés Segovia and the ORTVE, making recordings for RNE, the Ballet Nacional de España and the RTVE Música label. As a recording artist, he has released two works on the Adora New Music label: AXIS, with his saxophone quartet, and DELTA, his most recent album in collaboration with pianist Manuel Corbacho.",
